# StackOverflow Enthusiast Badge
This is an experiment project, in which I am trying to acquire the enthusiast badge in stack overflow.

To earn this badge a user has to visit the site each day for 30 consecutive days. (Days are counted in UTC.)

I visit the site mostly but on weekends I forget to visit the site, so I have decided to automate the site login each day.

To achieve this I'm using Selenium Driver and PhantomJs which is a headless browser that can be used with Selenium automation.

Then I'm using a console program which is invoked by the windows scheduler everyday.
